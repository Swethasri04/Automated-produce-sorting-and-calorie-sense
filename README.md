# Automated Produce Sorting and Calorie Sense 🍎🥦

This project aims to classify fruits and vegetables using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and determine their calorie content through web scraping. Fuzzy logic is integrated for quality assessment, enhancing contrast and evaluating fruit/vegetable quality. A user-friendly interface is built using Streamlit.

## 🚀 Features

- Classify produce (fruit/vegetable) from uploaded images using a trained CNN.
- Predict calorie content via live web scraping from Google.
- Assess produce quality using fuzzy logic techniques.
- Streamlit-powered web interface.
- Flask API support for image classification (optional backend service).
- Trained on Kaggle’s Fruit and Vegetable Image Dataset.
